Hey there, I'm Emily!

I'm a third-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://colorado.edu/cs) and the [Institute of Cognitive Science](https://colorado.edu/ics) at CU Boulder. In general, I'm interested in how technology can provide a personalized learning experience and possibly help us develop better behaviors. You can read more on [my research page](https://emilykjensen.github.io/research/).

One of my goals in grad school is to maintain a life outside of grad school; depending on the day, you can find me drinking tea, reading dystopian novels, knitting, trail running (apparently it's a requirement in Boulder), and figuring out how to use my road bike.

As someone with interests at the intersection of a lot of different fields, I really struggled through the graduate school application process. On top of that, I didn't know what to look for in a program or what the daily life of a graduate student looked like. If you have questions about these as well, I would be [happy to chat](mailto:emily.jensen@colorado.edu) about my experience or connect you with someone more knowledgeable.
