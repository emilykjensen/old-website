Hey there, I'm Emily!

I'm a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://colorado.edu/cs) and the [Institute of Cognitive Science](https://colorado.edu/ics) at CU Boulder advised by [Sriram Sankaranarayanan](https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~srirams/index.html) and [Brad Hayes](http://www.bradhayes.info/). In general, I'm interested in how people understand and choose to interact with autonomous systems. You can read more on [my research page](https://emilykjensen.github.io/research/).

One of my goals in grad school is to maintain a life outside of grad school; depending on the day, you can find me drinking tea, reading dystopian novels, knitting, running or hitting the trails (sometimes at the same time), and learning to use my road bike. I also post an [open diary of sorts](https://emilykjensen.github.io/research/) on this site to show that goals, motivation, and progress through grad school (and life) isn't anywhere close to linear.

As someone with interests at the intersection of a lot of different fields, I really struggled through the graduate school application process. On top of that, I didn't know what to look for in a program or what the daily life of a graduate student looked like. If you have questions about these as well, I would be [happy to chat](mailto:emily.jensen@colorado.edu) about my experience or connect you with someone more knowledgeable.
