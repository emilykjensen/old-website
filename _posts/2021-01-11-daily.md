# Thoughts from today

Mixed outcomes today. Went to the Endurance PhD Intensive workshop this morning and felt really motivated and inspired to continue working on my own productivity routine. Was going to make a quick cup of tea before heading into work after the workshop, but ran into some maintenance issues at home that completely derailed me. It is really frustrating when things like that are out of your control. Did end up getting in some focused time today, but didn't quite manage to check much off my list. Going to try bust out this application for a summer internship tonight so I can stop worrying about it! Looking forward to tomorrow since I get to go for a run, enjoy another workshop day, and hopefully the maintenance team will come to the rescue.
