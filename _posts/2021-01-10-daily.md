Forgot to write this on the day, so will do a brief overview of my training for the day.

# Running log
- goal: 4 mile "long run"
- warm up: dynamic warm up and 0.5 miles of brisk walking before run.
- equipment notes: went out to a tame trail, which had gotten a few inches of snow the night before. Traction was fine using my trail shoes, but my feet were definitely soggy and cold by the end of it. Core warmth was totally fine, used long sleeves + canopy jacket + puffy vest.
- injury notes: ankle felt great, probably because the snow was soft. My hips and lower back hurt by the end from the stability challenge.
- workout notes: was in the car for about 3 minutes before I realized I forgot my watch at home. So much for monitoring heart rate! Tried to do the run by feel of effort, but of course the snow made everything harder. Probably went harder than the strict "easy" pace.
