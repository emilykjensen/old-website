# Thoughts from today
Trying to keep a regular sleep schedule, so I got to sit on the couch with my book and watch the sun rise. I also finished another book today! Curious whether I can keep up this volume for the year. It was sort of a lazy day on the couch, but I noticed that I was getting sleepy every time I was sitting too long. Ended up going for a long walk before lunch and also made a bike excursion to a coffee shop later in the afternoon. I put off my workout for the day until the evening, which I shouldn't have done. I don't like doing the circuit routine, so I was positively dreading it by the evening. At least it is over! Tomorrow I want to work on some student government stuff and get my week planned with my new goals.
