# Running log
- goal: 1.5 miles easy, 6 x (1 minute at 10:45 or faster, 1 minute recovery), 1 mile easy
- warm up: dynamic warm up and 10 minutes of brisk walking
- equipment notes: weird weather yesterday so I hazarded on overdressing. Ended up with tank under canopy jacket which wasn't too bad.
- injury notes: bottom of my heel is a bit tender, maybe from tromping around in the snow? Ankle a bit sore the next day, but hopefully will be recovered by tomorrow
- workout notes: a lot of things that didn't quite add up to a good run today. Didn't wait enough after eating lunch, didn't drink enough water earlier in the day, thinking too hard. The LHR sections involved a lot of walking, which was frustrating. But need to remember this is a long-term goal!

# Thoughts from today
Got 2 papers accepted to LAK today! That is really exciting, and almost worth the lost sleep spent putting them together at the last minute. Spent a lot of time in the car yesterday picking up roommate from the airport, lunch, and then a run. Then the day was over! This was the last day of the Endurance PhD Intensive, feeling really motivated to get my daily routine up and running again.
