New Year's resolutions are hard. Instead of making a yearly goal that is hard to stick to, the theme of the year is _consistency and sustainability_. I want to make habits that are flexible and will last for years. Therefore, I have identified 6 main areas of my life I want to improve and will make a monthly goal. Each month's goal will be a small item to focus on for the whole month. If it doesn't work, I will try something else the next month. Otherwise, I will build off of it in the following month! This page will get updated over the course of the year along with notes about the process.
