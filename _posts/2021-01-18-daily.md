# Thoughts from today
Morning routine was really nice today! Got in my workout, shower, breakfast, tidying, and started on my grocery list. I budgeted my time into 30-minute chunks today. A lot of that time was spent reading the textbook to prepare for office hours, which no one showed up to this afternoon. I also made some progress on my homework and completed a review of a paper. While I did stick to my email blocks, I didn't do a good job separating the email from the task. I also got off track on my nutrition today, but tomorrow is a new day to keep it up. Since I started prepping lunch for the week late, I'm not going to get to bed as early as I wanted. However, I will still get the things on my night routine checked off. Shin is a bit tender today, but hoping that it will feel better tomorrow!
