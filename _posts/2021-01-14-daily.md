# Thoughts from today
Somehow spent several hours checking emails today? This is what happens when you don't make a to-do list. Had a great conversation with my therapist today about flexibility when setting goals, so I want to rethink my approach to goals for this year. A little bit of ankle soreness today, hopefully that will go away. I also got up and did my strength training immediately this morning, along with an 8-mile bike ride before 8am. So nice to see the mountains in the morning! Will use that as motivation to move my workouts to the morning again.

How is tomorrow Friday? My goal is to do at least one block of concentrated work so I feel like I was somewhat productive this week.
