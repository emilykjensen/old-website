# Thoughts from today
Today's date is a palindrome! Went for a nice morning walk on the trail while my roommates went for a run. I didn't want to be rushed so I am planning on doing my run tomorrow. I'm a little nervous about going out for 6 miles, but we will take it easy. I went to an accessibility workshop this morning. Even though I am not the main instructor for the course, there are some good tips for how to make content easy for all students to access. I spent most of my time today following up on tasks that have been on my to-do list for a while and it feels better to not have them in the back of my mind. I submitted an application for a summer fellowship today! The rest of the day was spent on homework and getting up to date on the new research project. Ended with a nice wind down for the evening, I suddenly got a lot of books in from the library so there are plenty to choose from for evening reading!
