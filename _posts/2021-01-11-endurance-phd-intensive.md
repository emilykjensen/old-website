# The notes

This workshop is a condensed version of the weekly productivity seminars I have been attending over the last semester. Each day of the workshop has a different theme, but all of the ideas will tie together. If you are a grad student at CU Boulder, consider signing up for the seminars [here](https://www.colorado.edu/graduateschool/endurance-phd)! I have found them to be very motivating.

## Day 1: The Four Tendencies

- The theory of four Tendencies is from Gretchen Rubin (take the quiz [here](https://quiz.gretchenrubin.com)).
- Your tendency describes how you respond to external and internal expectations. 
	- For example, I am a questioner, which means I have no problem working to meet inner expectations, but I resist outer expectations unless I understand why it is important. That means I need to understand _why_ I am doing something; saying "because I said so" is not motivating in the slightest.
	- One of the difficulties questioners face is that they can talk themselves into and out of anything. If I don't feel like doing reading for reseach one day, I can make up a bunch of excuses like "the internet is bad today" or "it's more urgent that the laundry gets folded". Leslie calls this action "spotting loopholes". This is dangerous because you can talk yourself out of doing anything if you are not in the mood. Additionally, this burns a lot of mental energy while you are figuring out what to do that day. You can't depend on willpower to last forever!
	- Some of the most helpful strategies for questioners: develop clarity of purpose, be mindful of spotting loopholes, monitor trends in productivity, and be able to distinguish why one behavior is better than another so you feel justified in continuing the behavior.
- Why are looking at tendencies helpful?
	- Understanding your motivation helps develop resilience and lowers barriers to getting things done. You can set up systems that let you make less decisions about what to do.
	- Predictability increases happiness because it decreases stress
- If you have an addictive personaliy, you need to abstain from the things that are bad for you. For example, if you can't just have 2 oreos, then probabaly stay away from oreos altogether. While I have been fortunate to not suffer from substance addiction, I do think I have an addictive personality. I can't do something halfway, whether that is reading books about running, trying out a new productivity system, or meal planning. This tends to lead to burnout and frustration. I can make rules to moderate, but find they feel too restrictive, or I can always rationalize why I don't need to follow the rule this time. To avoid this, I should identify behaviors that are harmful (at the moment I'm mostly thinking of sugar) and make a plan to avoid them.
- We will engage in behaviors that are more convenient and avoid behaviors that are inconvenient. Will come back to this more when we talk about forming habits!
- You don't have separate personal and professional personalities. If you are a questioner, then that tendency applies to both work and home.
- One possible way to motivate change is a "lightening bolt". As a questioner, you need to keep in mind the reason this motivated you in order to keep up momentum. For me, this usually happens when I read an especially good book or when I get so sick of my bad habits that I want to jump start a new system of habits.
- What happens when inner expectations are in conflict with outer expectations? Go back to make sure your values are being reflected in your decisions. Will come back to this more when we talk about values.
- Habits are important so you don't spend all your energy making decisions. You need to trust your plan more than your feelings in the moment.
- Short term vs. long term goals are a constant struggle of urgent vs. important tasks (see [Eisenhower Matrix](https://www.eisenhower.me/eisenhower-matrix/))
	- To prioritize important things, need to create space to do it every day to remove resistance (even if it is only 15 minutes at first). The important work will get prioritized in productivity blocks, while urgent things can happen during other times of the day.
	- You also need to accept that things aren't going to be perfect the first time. You can't improve on it until it is outside of your brain!
- What if you really hate doing the thing? You need to think about how the task is getting you to your big-picture goal. Also the thing is piling up while you are procrastinating!
- How do advocate for your productivity needs when you are not in a position of power? 
	- I have definitely struggled with this as a graduate student. Some areas where this may come up is expectations about responding to emails and scheduling meetings at all times throughout the week, even though you have peak productivity hours at certain times of day. 
	- Hopefully your advisor or supervisor is open to hearing your thoughts on this, since it benefits them for you to be more productive!
	- If they won't budge, then keep in mind that this position is only temporary.
