# Thoughts from today

Stayed up last night to ring in the new year! Sleep was a little fractured and so ended up sleeping in a lot. Tried not to let that bother me and focused on the rest of the day: eating well, staying hydrated, getting outside for a little bit. It was a nice quiet day and got to make some progress on a show with my roommates. I definitely feel better after taking the last week and a half off, but ready to get back onto a normal schedule starting next week! Need to be careful not to overdo it.

Instead of resolutions this year, I am trying out monthly goals. They feel a bit more concrete and also give me some flexibility to change focus as the year progresses. I have previously developed a "personal areas of growth" document for goal setting, and I am going to use those areas to set my monthly goals. While the 6 areas are clear, it was surprisingly hard to choose a goal for each that was appropriate for the month. Some of my ideas felt like they would only need a week, while others were way too big for a month. I also tend to want to fix and optimize *everything, right now*, so I am holding myself back a bit to aim for sustainable change, a little bit at a time. We will see if this strategy is working in a few months!
