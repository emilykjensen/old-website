# Thoughts from today
A nice day today! Got up at the usual time and got some reading done and work for student government before other people woke up. Had a good coffee chat and then a late lunch and some more reading in the afternoon. Got a new chess set in the mail today and got soundly trounced by my roommate. We also watched the new Soul movie today and it was really good! An overall mix of relaxing with a tiny bit of productivity mixed in.
