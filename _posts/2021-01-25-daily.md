# Running log
- goal: 6 miles easy
- warm up: dynamic warm up and 0.5 miles walking
- equipment notes: kept tape on from yesterday, pretty much same kit.
- injury notes: feeling surprisingly good, considering I ran the same distance yesterday. Pretty much no pain at all, but need to stay motivated to keep up with stretching and PT
- workout notes: started the route with some uphills and it seems like I have been getting better at regulating effort. There were some long stretches without walking which was great! Overall a little tired from yesterday but still feeling really good at the end of my run.

# Thoughts from today
So many meetings... Run went long this morning so I decided to take a shower and eat during the time I was hoping to get some work done. Brain was completely fried by the end of the day. Stayed up way too late because I was anxious about checking email and didn't feel like I had accomplished enough to "deserve" to go to bed. Finally ran out of things to do to procrastinate so going to head to bed way later than usual. Gonna try get some work done in the morning and do my run in the afternoon tomorrow.
