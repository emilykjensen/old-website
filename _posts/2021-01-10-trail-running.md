# Summary
A comprehensive guide for new and experienced trail runners, published in 2010. The book includes sections on sport history, training, etiquette, nutrition, and directing a race.

# Main Take-aways
Even though the book came out 10 years ago, trails haven't changed much. While I wish some sections had more detail, it was a good overview to the sport. I especially appreciated the section on wildlife and dangerous weather. The etiquette seems common sense, but it's sad to see a lot of these tips are not followed by people in Boulder. Hopefully I can find a group in the future that is less "elite" focused and supports recreational runners.
