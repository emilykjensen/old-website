# Thoughts from today

Was scheduled for a run today, but pushing back a day since I'm having some stiffness and soreness in my ankle. Nothing really bad, but don't want to make it worse by going out for a run. Continued productivity workshop today which focused on habits. Had initial meeting about a new research project and I am looking forward to contributing something new to this team, which is pretty formal-methods focused. Took a bit of a lunch/decompression break and then back to zoom for a 2 hour TA training from the department. Didn't get any real work done, but my brain is dead. Feeling a bit sad during the evening, not really sure why.
