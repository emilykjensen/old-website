# Summary
A set of 24 sci-fi stories related to futuristic space stuff, published 1958.

# Main Take-aways
It was really fun to read about the author's ideas of going to the moon since the stories were written before the moon landing! Some themes still exist today, like searching for intelligent life and the need to colonize new planets. I loved the author's style, makes me want to read 2001: A Space Odyssey again.

My top stories from the book:
- The Nine Billion Names of God
- The Wall of Darkness
- Security Check
- No Morning After
- All the Time in the World
