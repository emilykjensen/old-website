# Thoughts from today
Another busy day today. I had introductory meetings with two new research groups today and it was nice to see new people! I did manage to check everything off my list although it took longer than I was expecting. I had a networking call with someone working at Intel today and it was cool to hear the journey they took to their current position. It gives me hope that I will be able to find my way to something I like doing even if it takes a couple tries to get there. Morning routine is going pretty well, even though my bike ride this morning was so cold! Evening routines have been a bit iffy since I have been going to bed late, so I will try get to bed on time today.
