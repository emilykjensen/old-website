Forgot to write this on the day, so will do a brief overview of my training for the day.

# Running log
- goal: 2.5 miles under low heart rate threshold + 4 x 20 second strides at the end.
- warm up: dynamic warm up and 0.5 miles of brisk walking before run.
- equipment notes: don't remember any problems, which is good!
- injury notes: only a very slight stiffness in the ankle, but better than previous runs. No soreness the next day.
- workout notes: the first mile using LHR was faster than the others, but got slower in the later half. Probably from going uphill! Did struggle with breathing a bit because of nose congestion. I've found that nose vs. mouth breathing is a good indicator of effort, but it doesn't help if you have to blow your nose every two minutes. The strides at the end were super fun because I haven't gone fast in a while! I was definitely sore the next day, since I don't normally use those muscle groups (for long leg extension).
