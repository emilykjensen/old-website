I recently attended a professional development workshop through the [ITSS](https://www.colorado.edu/cartss/interdisciplinary-training-social-sciences-itss) program.

The November 13 workshop was called "How to Network Professionally" and was led by [Dr. Anand Sokhey](https://sites.google.com/a/colorado.edu/aes/).
