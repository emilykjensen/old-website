# Running log
- goal: 1 mile easy, 3 x (1km at 11:00 - 11:10 pace, 90 seconds recovery), 1 mile easy
- warm up: dynamic warm up and 0.6 miles brisk walking
- equipment notes: sunny but cold outside today. Ended up overheating a bit with gloves, canopy jacket, long sleeves, and vest. I liked wearing my new sunglasses today, but it was difficult to manage them with ear covers, headphones, and mask loops.
- injury notes: ankle felt great today, still with the same tape on. I took the tape off after and have some soreness, but we will see if it goes away.
- workout notes: those intervals were hard, but it was nice to have a tiring workout. I struggled with the easy efforts, not sure if I was flustered in the middle of the day or something else. My heart rate kept creeping up towards the end so I ended up walking a lot of the last mile.

# Thoughts from today
Instead of doing my run in the morning (9 degrees, super cold!) I opted to work on creating a quiz for class in the morning before others got up. It was nice and quiet in the house and pretty productive! My afternoon time was then taken up with the run but I was able to complete the quiz in the evening.
