# Thoughts from today
Didn't run today because I was up late last night and it was snowing on and off all day today. I didn't really do any research today, but did make some progress on my own classwork and had people come to my office hours for the first time today. It felt good being able to help a few people! I am pretty exhausted by the end of the day, so I'm going to try go to bed early and start tomorrow fresh. There are some good chunks of free time on my schedule so my main goal is to get a draft of the quiz questions done.
