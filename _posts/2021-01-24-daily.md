# Running log
- goal: 6 miles easy
- warm up: dynamic warm up and 0.5 miles walking
- equipment notes: taped up left arch and up calf, felt pretty good after first 2 miles. Face was cold today but overall warm enough!
- injury notes: Was a little nervous going out because I had some pain from Friday's run. However it seemed to get better during the run and not feeling any problems in the evening. I need to stay on top of PT.
- workout notes: a little muscle fatigue at the end, since this is my longest week in a while. But I felt great overall and cautiously optimistic about going out again tomorrow!

# Thoughts from today
Got up in the morning and came back with groceries before half of the house was up. Got in a couple of (losing) chess matches with my roommate before we headed out for our run. Also got a couple of loads of laundry in and tidied my room a bit, so I feel ready for this week. I know there are a lot of meetings tomorrow, so I am trying to be intentional with my time and not schedule too many things. Feeling a bit nervous because I am already behind on my goal sleep schedule, but I thought it was more important to have a plan if it means being a few minutes late to bed.
