# Thoughts from today

Today was the first day "back to work" after taking some time off from email. While I did enjoy the time off, I did not enjoy loggin in to see 79 unread emails. Fortunately, most of them didn't require any action. I deleted all of the news emails without reading. 

Instead of forcing my brain back into full work mode right away, my main goal for today was just to spend more time doing technically productive things at my desk. Put on real clothes, make a to-do list, answer some emails. I'm going to do a single 25-minute pomodoro just to say I concentrated on something important today. It was hard to convince myself to get started, but I did get a few minutes in where I was focused and getting some ideas coming in. I took a nice walk afer lunch today to enjoy the weirdly warm January weather. Finished listening to another audiobook! It was a nice short one compared to the longer books I've been getting into lately.

I am eager to start implementing deep work after reading the book, but I don't really have much to work on right now. I need to set some research goals for the semester!

Feeling the tiniest bit of soreness after yesterday's run. Put on compression socks and hoping it will go away by tomorrow.
