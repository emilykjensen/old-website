Abstract: This chapter discusses the ubiquity and importance of emotion to learning. It argues substantial progress can be made by coupling discovery-oriented, data-driven, analytic methods of learning analytics and educational data mining with theoretical advances and methodologies from the affective and learning sciences. Core, emerging, and future themes of research at the intersection of these areas are discussed.
