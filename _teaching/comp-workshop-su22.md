Organizer and instructor for pilot workshop targeting graduate students in Summer 2022.  
I taught core concepts to allow students to teach themselves whatever coding task might be required for their research. Created weekly slides, facilitated the weekly discussion, and compiled resources for attendees. Topics included control structures, variables, data types, and project organization.
