This was an oral presentation as part of my preliminary exam. The goal is to display a working knowledge of your research field and synthesize common themes and future work. My guiding question asked "how can adaptive systems train humans to perform complex tasks?". The presentation drew on literature from automated systems, education, and intelligent tutoring systems.
