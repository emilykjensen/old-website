This was a poster presentation of preliminary results at the Computer Science department graduate research expo. This eventually became the paper with a similar name accepted to the [Educational Data Mining 2019](https://educationaldatamining.org/edm2019/) conference. You can find the [paper here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kRyhcP9Wxd74xiZMsGW89dNO5sBVtAx1/view). This won the Best Research Poster Award for the department!
